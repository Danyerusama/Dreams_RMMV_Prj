## Key Features of the Starting Game:
Atmospheric Opening Sequence: The game starts with a compelling and visually stunning opening sequence designed to immediately draw players into our world.
Narrative Introduction: Before the main menu title appears, players are introduced to the foundational elements of the story, setting the tone for the adventure that awaits.
Elegant Main Menu Design: Our main menu is not just a list of options; it is a carefully designed part of the game’s overall aesthetic and ambiance.
