Welcome to the initial phase of our exciting game project! In this section, we provide a detailed glimpse into the early stages of the game, all the way up to the appearance of the main menu title. Whether it’s the initial loading screen, the introductory narrative, or the artistic design of the title menu, we are committed to crafting an immersive and engaging experience from the very beginning.

## Key Features of the Starting Game:
- Atmospheric Opening Sequence: The game starts with a compelling and visually stunning opening sequence designed to immediately draw players into our world.
- Narrative Introduction: Before the main menu title appears, players are introduced to the foundational elements of the story, setting the tone for the adventure that awaits.
- Elegant Main Menu Design: Our main menu is not just a list of options; it is a carefully designed part of the game’s overall aesthetic and ambiance.
- What to Expect:
As you start the game, you will be introduced to the characters, setting, and basic controls through an intuitive and engaging sequence. This is designed to be more than just a tutorial; it's the first chapter of our story and an essential part of the gaming experience we are creating.
